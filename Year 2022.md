**Year 2022**

**1. Current Projects and Impact (Project IC - Redwing Core Team)**

*   **Role:** Sole QA Automation Engineer for the Redwing Core team.
*   **Automation Leadership:** Drove the automation strategy and implementation for Redwing Core Services.
*   **Coverage Achievement:** Significantly increased automation penetration and coverage to **over 90%** within the year.
*   **Framework Optimization:** Enhanced the Test Automation Framework, leading to:
    *   Improved stability and reliability of automated test executions.
    *   Reduction of manual test execution effort to **near zero**.
*   **Efficiency Gains & Resource Optimization:**
    *   Streamlined the testing cycle, reducing the required resources from 2 FTEs to **1 FTE**.
    *   This optimization translates to an estimated saving of **~1 FTE (~2000 hours) annually** for the Redwing Core team's testing efforts.
*   **Impact of Efficiency:** Reallocated saved resource time towards valuable Exploratory Testing, significantly boosting test depth.
*   **Quality & Confidence:** Contributed to increased team confidence across **19+ successful releases** with **zero defect leakages** into production.

**2. Impact Beyond IC**

*   **Problem Solved:** Addressed the critical gap left by the decommissioning of the internal 'Bluegrid' solution, which prevented automated tests from running in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Pioneering Initiative:** Successfully implemented **Selenium Grid on the GKP cloud platform**, noted as a **"First within JPMorgan"** for this specific implementation, enabling modern, scalable test execution.
*   **Cross-Organizational Collaboration:** Partnered effectively with central Testing COE (Center of Excellence) teams.
*   **Wider Rollout & Enablement:** Actively assisted COE in rolling out the Selenium Grid on GKP solution to other impacted teams across the organization (impacting **at least 3 teams** initially and enabling wider adoption).
*   **Team Modernization & Throughput:**
    *   Enabled high-throughput parallel test execution (handling **200+ scenarios per hour** during releases) compared to previous single-threaded execution.
    *   Significantly reduced execution time for large test suites (**1000+ tests weekly** across participating teams). Estimated reduction in execution wall-clock time by **over 70-80%** compared to sequential runs.
    *   **Estimated Annual Time Savings:** This efficiency translates to potentially saving **4000-5000+ hours annually** in reduced execution wall-clock time *across the initial adopting teams*, facilitating faster feedback cycles.
    *   **Projected Cumulative Savings:** Since implementation in 2022, the projected cumulative execution time savings delivered by the GKP Selenium Grid for the *initial adopting teams* are estimated to be **over 11,000 hours** by early 2025. (Note: Actual organizational savings are significantly higher due to broader adoption).
*   **Overall Contribution:** Provided a critical, scalable, and modern testing infrastructure component benefiting multiple teams beyond the immediate project, fostering efficiency and faster delivery cycles across the organization.
