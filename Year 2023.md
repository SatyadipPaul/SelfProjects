**Year 2023**

**1. Current Projects and Impact**

*   **Expanded Role:** Contributed simultaneously as QA Automation Engineer for both **Redwing Core (Project IC)** and **VET QA for TIM Automation**.
*   **Redwing Core (Project IC):**
    *   **Critical Migration Support:** Played a key QA role in the project-critical migration from **VSI to GKP infrastructure**. This involved supporting **intensive regression cycles**, sometimes up to **4 releases per month** towards the end of the year.
    *   **Quality Assurance:** Successfully maintained **zero defect leakages** into Production throughout this high-intensity migration period, contributing significantly to the **"Production Green" milestone** for the Redwing Core team.
    *   **Continued Efficiency:** Continued to maintain and support the highly automated testing infrastructure
*   **TIM Automation (VET QA):**
    *   **Critical Project Phase:** Joined the team during a crucial application migration phase, requiring the update and migration of obsolete test scripts.
    *   **SME Contribution:** Leveraged established automation expertise from Redwing Core to guide and enhance the VET Automation efforts.
    *   **Framework Enhancement:** Implemented **Major Optimizations** within the VET Automation Framework, improving its structure, maintainability, and efficiency.
    *   **Reporting Strategy Improvement:** Overhauled and enhanced the test automation reporting strategy, providing clearer and more actionable insights into test results.
    *   **Recognition:** Contributions were highly regarded and well-appreciated by the team and stakeholders for bringing significant improvements.

**2. Impact Beyond IC**

*   **Identifying Modern Solutions:** Recognized the need for advanced UI validation within the "TIM Automation" project to ensure efficient, early detection of UI changes/bugs with minimal false positives, especially critical during the application migration.
*   **Applitools Implementation Driver:**
    *   Proactively identified **Applitools Eyes SDK**, an existing firm-wide AI-powered visual testing platform, as the ideal solution.
    *   **Championed and Drove Adoption:** Led the initiative to integrate Applitools Eyes SDK into the team's Selenium JAVA framework.
    *   **Technical Leadership & Onboarding:** Singlehandedly managed the technical integration and successfully onboarded the VET QA team and framework onto the Applitools platform.
    *   **User-Centric Design:** Employed an "intensive and radical thinking approach" to abstract the complexities of Applitools, delivering a seamless integration usable by the team without deep specialized knowledge.
*   **AI-Driven Validation & Efficiency Gains for TIM Application:**
    *   Implemented comprehensive AI-powered visual validation for **129 critical TIM application scenarios**. This strategy leveraged Applitools' AI to visually check thousands of UI elements across flows and roles instantly.
    *   **Massive Effort Avoidance (Initial):** This AI-driven approach bypassed the immense effort of traditional, element-by-element UI scripting for visual checks. Scripting these 129 scenarios manually would have potentially required **over 4,100 Man Hours** (calculated at an estimated 4 days/scenario, 8hrs/day) for initial development alone.
    *   **Reduced Maintenance Overhead:** Significantly reduced the ongoing maintenance burden typical of brittle UI test scripts. Compared to manually updating traditional scripts for UI changes across release cycles, this approach potentially saves **an estimated 300-500+ Man Hours annually**. (Calculation based on potential rework for a fraction of scenarios over multiple releases).
    *   **Proven Quality Value:** Since implementation, Applitools has helped the TIM team identify **at least 10 unintended application changes**, serving as a crucial **first line of defense** against visual regressions that traditional test scripting might otherwise miss.
    *   **Improved Speed & Focus:** Significantly improved the speed and reliability of UI testing for TIM, allowing the team to focus on functional testing and analysis rather than intricate UI scripting and maintenance.
*   **Modernization:** Further contributed to the modernization of testing practices within the VET QA team by introducing and successfully implementing AI-driven visual validation, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains and improved quality outcomes.
