Tired of getting lost in large Spring Boot codebases? Need a quick way to visualize dependencies, find specific components, or trace method calls without firing up your full IDE?

**Spring Boot Code Explorer** is a powerful command-line tool designed to statically analyze your Spring Boot projects, providing an interactive interface to browse code structure, identify Spring components, search through code, analyze method flows, and more!

## ‚ú® Why Use Spring Boot Code Explorer?

*   **Rapid Code Understanding:** Quickly grasp the structure and key components of unfamiliar Spring Boot projects.
*   **Dependency Tracing:** Visualize method call chains (who calls what, and what is called by whom).
*   **Component Discovery:** Easily list Controllers, Services, Repositories, Entities, Configurations, etc.
*   **Targeted Search:** Find specific methods or code snippets (identifiers, string literals) across the project.
*   **Offline Analysis:** Analyze code without needing a running application or heavy IDE indexing.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Speed up debugging, onboarding, and refactoring tasks.
*   **Git Integration:** Create patch files directly from your uncommitted changes.
*   **Text Conversion:** Easily export selected files or directories to `.txt` format for further processing or documentation.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Interactive CLI:** A user-friendly, menu-driven interface for exploring your project.
*   **Project Structure View:** Display the project's file tree or browse it interactively.
*   **Spring Component Identification:** Detects and lists common Spring stereotypes (`@Controller`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Component`, `@Configuration`, `@Entity`, etc.).
*   **Component Details:** View annotations, fields, methods, inheritance, and implementation details for specific components.
*   **Method Analysis:**
    *   View method source code snippets.
    *   Trace outgoing method calls (limited depth).
    *   Trace incoming method calls (limited depth).
*   **Code Search:**
    *   Search for methods by name (case-insensitive).
    *   Search for string literals or identifiers within the codebase.
*   **Git Patch Creation:** Generate a `.patch` file from your current `git diff HEAD` (uncommitted changes). Supports binary diffs.
*   **File Conversion:** Convert specific files or entire directories to plain text (`.txt`) format, optionally preserving directory structure.
*   **Caching:** Caches analysis results (`.explorer_cache/`) for significantly faster startup on subsequent runs. Cache automatically invalidates if source files change.
*   **Colorized Output:** Enhances readability in supported terminals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

*   **Python 3.7+**
*   **Git:** Required for the "Create Git Patch" feature. Ensure it's installed and in your system's PATH.
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `javalang`: For parsing Java source code.
    *   `networkx`: For building and analyzing the method call graph.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-code-explorer.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd spring-boot-code-explorer
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install javalang networkx
    ```
    *(Consider creating a `requirements.txt` file for easier dependency management)*

## üöÄ Usage

Run the explorer from your terminal using Python's `-m` flag, pointing it to the package directory (`spring_explorer`).

**General Syntax:**

```bash
python -m spring_explorer [PROJECT_PATH] [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments & Options:**

*   `PROJECT_PATH`: (Optional) The path to the root directory of the Spring Boot project you want to analyze. Defaults to the current directory (`.`).
*   `--no-cache`: (Optional) Ignores any existing analysis cache and forces a full re-analysis. Also clears the existing cache if found.
*   `--force-color`: (Optional) Forces colored terminal output, even if the terminal doesn't report support.
*   `--clear-cache-only`: (Optional) Clears the cache for the specified `PROJECT_PATH` and exits immediately. Does not run the analysis or interactive mode.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Analyze the project in the current directory
python -m spring_explorer

# Analyze a project at a specific path
python -m spring_explorer /path/to/my-spring-app

# Analyze the current project, ignoring the cache
python -m spring_explorer --no-cache

# Clear the cache for a specific project and exit
python -m spring_explorer /path/to/my-spring-app --clear-cache-only
```

## üß≠ Interactive Mode Guide

Upon running, the tool performs an initial analysis (or loads from cache) and presents the main menu:

```

    *   **List Parsing Errors:** Shows any errors encountered by `javalang` while parsing Java files.

---

### 0. Exit

*   Exits the Spring Boot Code Explorer.

## üíæ Caching

*   To speed up subsequent runs, the tool caches analysis results (ASTs, component info, call graph) in a `.explorer_cache` directory within your project root.
*   The cache is automatically invalidated and analysis is re-run if any `.java`, `.properties`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, or `.xml` files in your project have been modified since the cache was created.
*   You can force a cache clear and re-analysis using the `--no-cache` command-line option or the "Clear Cache & Re-analyze" option in the Settings menu.
*   Use `--clear-cache-only` to just remove the cache without running the tool.
